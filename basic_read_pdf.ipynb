A  key  challenge  to  HAMR \\ndesigning is accuracy of positioning, timing of the firing laser, power \\nof  the  laser,  thermo-magnetic  head,  head-disk  interface  and  cooling \\nsystem.  We  study  the  effect  of  HAMR  parameters  on  transition \\ncenter  and  transition  width.  The  HAMR  is  model  using  Thermal \\nWilliams-Comstock  (TWC)  and  microtrack  model.  The  target  and \\nequalizer are designed by the minimum mean square error (MMSE). \\nThe  result  shows  that  the  unit  energy  constraint  outperforms  other \\nconstraints.  \\n\\nKeywords—Heat-Assisted  Magnetic  Recording,  Thermal \\n\\nWilliams-Comstock equation, Microtrack model, Equalizer. \\n\\nI.  INTRODUCTION \\n\\nT\\n\\nHE  proliferation  of  digital  content  creation  and \\nconsumption brings an increasing demand for data storage \\ndevices,  such  as  the  hard  disk  drive  (HDD).  This  demand \\ndrives  requires  increasing  storage  capacity,  which  in  turns \\ndrives increasing growth in areal density (AD). AD is defined \\nas the number of bits stored in a bit area of medium and it is \\ndetermined by the average size of the grains and the number of \\ngrains that is used to store 1 bit of information. To increase the \\nAD, the magnetic grain size must be reduced and to maintain \\nthe right levels of  signal to noise  ratio  (SNR),  the number  of \\ngrains  per  bit  must  be  constant.  However,  small  grains  will \\nface thermal instability problem. To remedy this issue, media \\nneed to have high coercivity (Hc) which means anisotropy (Ku) \\nis high and, therefore, it is difficult to write data bits because \\nthe  current  write  field  limitation.  Heat-assisted  magnetic \\nrecording (HAMR) channel model has been developed and the \\nthermal  Williams-Comstock  (TWC)  model  has  been  used  to \\npredict  the  limitation.  HAMR  is  one  of  the  four  enabling \\ntechnologies which surpass the critical point of storage density \\nlimit known as the super-paramagnetic limit at 1 Tb/in2 AD, as \\nin [1]-[3].  \\n\\nNew  write  mechanism  has  been  researched  by  many \\nresearchers  around  the  world.  It  is  able  to  utilize  higher \\nanisotropy  to  produce  smaller  grain  sizes  and  to  secure  a \\nsignal  to  noise  ratio  (SNR)  and  bit  error  rate  (BER).  HAMR \\n\\nP.

The medium is then rapidly \\ncooled  down  to  the  room  temperature  after  magnetization \\ncompleted, where thermal stability is acceptable. \\n\\nFig. 1 The write-ability trilemma: the available from writer has to be \\ntrade off against thermal stability (large grains or high anisotropy) \\nand media SNR (small grains) [1] \\n\\nHAMR  system  has  many  thermal  issues  compared  to  the \\nconventional  magnetic  recording.  Hence,  each  work  step  and \\nthe whole system need to be researched and clarified, as well \\nas improving the stability and reliability of the system against \\nthermal issues.  The  HAMR  channel  model  has  recently  been \\ninvestigated  and  the  read  process  of  the  conventional  read \\nchannel  models  employed  in  current  magnetic  recording \\nsystems  has  been  used  to  produce  the  HAMR  playback \\nsignals, as in [4]-[11]. \\n\\nThe  organization  of this  paper  is  as  follows.  In  Section  II, \\nwe  will  describe  the  principles  of  perpendicular  HAMR \\nsystems using the Thermal Williams-Comstock (TWC) model, \\ntransition  parameters  and \\nto \\ndetermine the transition characteristics of both large and non-\\nlarge spot laser. Next in Section III, we will propose the target \\nand  equalizer  by  the  minimum-mean  squared  error  (MMSE) \\nmethod.  Then,  the  simulation  and  results  is  discussed  in \\nSection IV. Finally, the conclusion will be made in Section V.  \\n\\nthe  microtrack  modeling \\n\\nII.

Williams-Comstock (WC) Model \\nIn  1971,  Mason  Williams  and  Larry  Comstock  developed \\nthe  William-Comstock  (WC)  model  to  predict  the  transition \\nwidth  in  longitudinal  magnetic  recording,  as  in  [13].  They \\nprovide a simple analysis of the write process. WC model is a \\nwell-known approximate analytical model which describes the \\ntransition characteristics in a conventional magnetic recording \\nsystem.  In  the  model,  the  “zigzag”  nature  of  magnetic \\ntransition  is  ignored  and  the  shape  of  magnetic  transition  is \\npresumed  to  be  described  by  the  arctangent  function.  The \\ntransition center x0 and the transition parameter a are the two \\nmain parameters which can be derived from this model. \\n\\nThe  relationship  between  the  applied  field  Ha  and  the \\nresultant  magnetization  M  in  the  medium  is  given  by  the \\nhysteresis  loop  of  the  medium  and  can  be  written  as \\nM=Floop(Ha),  where  Floop  represents  the  hysteresis  loop.  The \\napplied  magnetic field  during  the transition  formation  can be \\ndescribed  by  the  contribution  from  the  head  field  Hh  and  the \\ndemagnetization field Hd from the recorded transition, i.e., \\n\\nB. Thermal Williams-Comstock (TWC) Model \\nFloop(Ha)  in  WC  model  does  not  account  for  the  effects  of \\nheating in  HAMR system.  In 2004, WC model  was extended \\nby  incorporating  thermal  gradients  of  coercivity  Hc  and \\nmagnetization  M  for  a  longitudinal  HAMR  system  and  is \\nknown as the Thermal Williams–Comstock (TWC) model, as \\nin  [4].  The  effective  field  (h)  is  introduced  to  account  for \\nheating behavior, i.e., \\n\\nh x\\n( )\\n\\n=\\n\\nH xa\\n( )\\nH T x\\n(\\n\\n( ))\\n\\nc\\n\\n.   \\n\\n            (4) \\n\\nThe dependence  of M on the temperature captured by h in \\n(4) is substituted into M=Floop(h).

Williams  and  Comstock  noted  that  is \\npossible  to  solve  the  derivative  of  (2)  by  evaluating  at  the \\ntransition center x0 where the applied field at x0 is equal to the \\ncoercivity Hc.

Furthermore, the \\nhead  field  gradient  dHh/dx  and  magnetization  gradient  with \\napplied  field  dM(H)/dHa  can  be  evaluated  from  the  analytic \\nKarlqvist  head  field  expressions  and  the  M–H  loop  for  the \\nmedium.

Target and Equalizer Design \\nIn  this  study,  we  design  targets  (HD)  and  equalizers  (FD) \\nby  using  the  minimum-mean  squared  error  (MMSE)  method \\nto  minimize  the  mean-squared  error  (MSE)  between  desired \\noutputs and equalizer outputs, as in [11], [14].

SIMULATION RESULTS \\nIn this work, the medium is assumed to be Fe55−xNixPt45L10 \\nwhere 10<x<30% because the linear relationship for remanent \\nmagnetization  Mr  and  coercivity  Hc  with  temperature  is \\nresulted in this range, as in [9], [10]. For all cases, the laser is \\nassumed  to  be  at  the  center  of  the  track  in  the  cross-track \\ndirection  but  varied \\nthe  down-track  direction.  The \\ntemperature induced by the laser is assumed to be Gaussian in \\nboth dimensions with the peak temperature of 330°C and track \\nwidth 20nm. System parameters are given in Table I. \\n\\nin \\n\\nWe  first  discuss the  results  from  Fig.  3.  Firstly,  we  fix  Mr \\nmagnetization  dependencies  on  temperature  to  study  the \\nbehavior of x0 and a by using various Hc. With magnetization \\ntemperature  (Mr=-1000T+1.8x106),  we \\ndependencies  on \\nfound  that  at  increasing  Hc,  x0  is  shifted  faraway  from  laser \\nposition and a is decreased. Secondly, we vary Mr to study x0 \\nand  a  by  using  Hc  =  -2900T+2.4x106  for  evaluation.  Fig.  4 \\nshows that x0 has almost the same values and small a is found \\nat low Mr. Small a means narrow transitions, hence, recording \\nbits are packed close together.  \\n\\nNext, we study x0 and a by focusing on the head field (H0). \\nThe results show that x0 is shifted  far from the laser position \\nand  a is  wider  at high  head  field as shown in Fig. 5. Finally, \\nusing  high  Hc,  low  Mr  and low  H0 to  evaluate the  system  by \\nvarying peak temperature (Tpeak), the results of this experiment \\nshow that high Tpeak will give small a as shown in Fig. 6. \\n\\nAs the discussion before, we select high Hc, low Mr, low H0 \\nand high Tpeak to evaluate the system. The transition response \\np(x) and bit response h(x) can be achieved and shown in Fig. \\n7. We get PW50 equal to 13.988 nm and hence ND is about 2. \\nThe  HAMR  playback  signal  is  obtained  by  the  convolution \\nbetween bk and px and corrupted from AWGN. The  playback \\nwith and without AWGN is shown in Fig. 8. Playback signal \\nfrom LPF is also shown in this Fig. 8. \\n\\nFor  MMSE  equalizer  design,  we  use  the  fixed  target \\nconstraint to minimize the MSE by setting the various number \\nof  equalizer  taps.  Equalizer  taps  are  in  the  range  of  3  to  21 \\ntaps. PR1 gives the lowest MMSE from all the targets for this \\ncase. The results are shown in Fig. 9. The MMSE value at 11-\\ntap  equalizer  is  equal  to  0.526.  The  11-tap  equalizer \\ncoefficients  are [0.044  -0.036  0.252  0.128  1.320  2.641  1.356 \\n0.404 0.166 0.033 -0.010] \\n\\nNext, we compare the MSE using four target constraints for \\nevaluation  and the range is from 3 to  21 taps.  We use 3-tabs \\ntarget  to  simulate  this  comparison.  The  result  shows  that  the \\nunit  energy  constraint  has  the  lowest  minimum  MSE,  as  in \\nFig.  10.  The  3-tap  target  with  11-tap  equalizer  has  the  MSE \\nequal  to  0.065.  The  h1=0  constraint  gives  the  MSE  of  0.105. \\nFor  h0  =  1  constraint,  the  minimum  MSE  of  this  targets  is \\n\\nf\\nd\\np\\n/\\n3\\n3\\n8\\n7\\n9\\n9\\n9\\n/\\ng\\nr\\no\\n.\\nt\\ne\\ns\\na\\nw\\n.\\ns\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\nc\\ni\\nl\\nb\\nu\\np\\n\\n4\\n1\\n0\\n2\\n\\n,\\n3\\n:\\no\\nN\\n\\n,\\n8\\n:\\nl\\no\\nV\\ng\\nn\\ni\\nr\\ne\\ne\\nn\\ni\\ng\\nn\\nE\\nn\\no\\ni\\nt\\na\\nc\\ni\\nn\\nu\\nm\\nm\\no\\nC\\nd\\nn\\na\\n\\ns\\nc\\ni\\nn\\no\\nr\\nt\\nc\\ne\\nl\\nE\\n\\n,\\nx\\ne\\nd\\nn\\nI\\n\\ne\\nc\\nn\\ne\\ni\\nc\\nS\\nn\\ne\\np\\nO\\n\\n0.091, and the fixed-target constraint using PR2 [1 2 1] has the \\nhighest MSE value equal to 1.890. \\n\\nSince  the  unit-energy  constraint  gives  the  lowest  MSE \\nvalue, we select the unit energy constraint to evaluate and find \\nthe MSE with the various number of target taps. Equalizer taps \\nare also in the range of 3 to 21 taps as the previous simulation. \\nFor the 11-tap equalizer, the 10-tap target gives the minimum \\nMSE  as  shown  in  Fig.  11.  The  11-tap  equalizer  coefficients \\nare  [-0.043  0.050  -0.126  0.186  -0.466  0.228  0.616  -0.956 \\n0.360 0.413 -0.438] and 10-tap target coefficients are [-0.261 \\n0.475 -0.109 -0.491 0.607 -0.142 -0.212 0.132 -0.039 0.021]. \\nThe MMSE value is 0.055.  \\n\\nV.  CONCLUSIONS \\nIn  this  paper,  we  use  the  thermal  William-Comstock \\nequation  to  model  the  perpendicular  heat  assisted  magnetic \\nrecording  with  non-large  thermal  laser  spot.  The  playback \\nsignal of HAMR can be affected from various parameters such \\nas  Hc.  Mr,  H0  and  Tpeak.  The  simulation  results  show  that  the \\nproper  high  Hc,  low  Mr,  low  H0  and  high  Tpeak  provide  the \\ngood  transition  parameters.  Moreover,  we  design  the  MMSE \\nequalizer  for  heat-assisted  magnetic  recording.  The  lowest \\nminimum  MSE  value  is  obtained  from  the  unit  energy \\nconstraint. \\n\\nTABLE I \\nSYSTEM PARAMETERS \\n\\nParameter \\ntrack width \\nnumber of sub-track \\nlaser position
